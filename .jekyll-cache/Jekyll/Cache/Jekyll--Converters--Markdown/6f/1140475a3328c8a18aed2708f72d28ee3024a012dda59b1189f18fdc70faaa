<p>Keeping all the details together in a family is a tricky business- everybody has their own schedules, needs, preferences, and ideas, and things can easily get chaotic! Bring all these into harmonee, a private place to communicate, plan, and prepare for all the extra notes life throws our way. Your family can use harmonee to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Make meals easier:
    <ul>
      <li>Easy filters to find the right recipe for each meal</li>
      <li>Plan meals a day, a week, or even a month in advance</li>
      <li>Create a shopping list in a click from your meal plan</li>
      <li>Share lists and recipes so they can add their favorites</li>
      <li>Keep track of the ingredients you have on hand with the in-app pantry</li>
      <li>Scan receipts to automatically add groceries, scan barcodes as you use items to remove them</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>See the due dates BEFORE they’re due:
    <ul>
      <li>Keep track of due dates, appointments, events, and schedules all in one place</li>
      <li>Easily add a list, task, or even a whole project to any calendar item</li>
      <li>Link your favorite calendar apps to share automatically</li>
      <li>Make a suggestion, and let your family weigh in on your event ideas!</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Work as a team:
    <ul>
      <li>Share lists, projects, ideas, and events with anybody you choose</li>
      <li>Set up roles and permissions to make sure those surprise party plans don’t get revealed too early</li>
      <li>Make requests that can be approved or denied by family guardians</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>We didn’t forget about the family who doesn’t live at home:
    <ul>
      <li>Connect households together with single use links right from the app</li>
      <li>Share whatever you want with connected families</li>
      <li>Create public spaces for all your clubs, groups, and hobbies</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Harmonee is currently in early, active development. Keep watch here as things develop!</p>
