# (Family) harmonee

Keeping all the details together in a family is a tricky business- everybody has their own schedules, needs, preferences, and ideas, and things can easily get chaotic! Bring all these into harmonee, a private place to communicate, plan, and prepare for all the extra notes life throws our way. Your family can use harmonee to:

- Make meals easier:
  - Easy filters to find the right recipe for each meal
  - Plan meals a day, a week, or even a month in advance
  - Create a shopping list in a click from your meal plan
  - Share lists and recipes so they can add their favorites
  - Keep track of the ingredients you have on hand with the in-app pantry
  - Scan receipts to automatically add groceries, scan barcodes as you use items to remove them
- See the due dates BEFORE they're due:
  - Keep track of due dates, appointments, events, and schedules all in one place
  - Easily add a list, task, or even a whole project to any calendar item
  - Link your favorite calendar apps to share automatically
  - Make a suggestion, and let your family weigh in on your event ideas!
- Work as a team:
  - Share lists, projects, ideas, and events with anybody you choose
  - Set up roles and permissions to make sure those surprise party plans don't get revealed too early
  - Make requests that can be approved or denied by family guardians
- We didn't forget about the family who doesn't live at home:
  - Connect households together with single use links right from the app
  - Share whatever you want with connected families
  - Create public spaces for all your clubs, groups, and hobbies

Harmonee is currently in early, active development. Keep watch here as things develop!
