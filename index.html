  <p>Keeping all the details together in a family is a tricky business- everybody has their own 
  schedules, needs, preferences, and ideas, and things can easily get chaotic! Bring all
  these into harmonee, a private place to communicate, plan, and prepare for all the extra
  notes life throws our way. Your family can use harmonee to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <h4>Make meals easier:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Easy filters to find the right recipe for each meal</li>

        <li>Create a shopping list in a click from your meal plan</li>
        <li>Share lists and recipes so they can add their favorites</li>
        <li>Keep track of the ingredients you have on hand with the in-app pantry</li>
